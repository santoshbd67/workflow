# Step 1: Set Up the Initial Document Details and Logs
Create a Log File: Begin by creating a log file specifically for this POC, naming it in a way that includes the date, time, and document ID. This file will record every action taken, every file path used, and any issues encountered, which is essential for debugging and validation.

Receive Document Metadata in JSON: The incoming document’s metadata will be received in JSON format. This metadata typically contains:

documentId: A unique identifier for the document.
location: The path of the document, which points to the stored PDF file.
mimeType: Generally set to "application/pdf" for a PDF document.
callbackUrl: A URL to which a callback response is sent after the document has been processed, confirming the completion of each stage.
Log Initial Metadata: Log all metadata received, especially documentId and location, to have a reference for the file paths and document identifiers throughout the process.

# Step 2: Define the Working Directories and Document Path
Define Working Directory: Identify the directory where the main processing will take place. This is usually a dedicated folder in a project environment where temporary and final files are stored.

Create Final Path for Document: Based on the location metadata provided, determine the absolute path to the document. This typically involves appending the document location to a base directory path. This final path will point to where the document is stored in the system.

Rename Document for Uniqueness: For better organization and to avoid conflicts with duplicate file names, rename the document based on its documentId. This ensures that every file is uniquely identifiable. The new path should be noted in the logs.

# Step 3: Upload Document to Azure Blob Storage
Prepare for Upload: To ensure the document is accessible for future stages, upload it to a cloud storage service like Azure Blob Storage. Azure Blob is ideal for managing files and integrating with other services.

Generate SAS (Shared Access Signature) Token: A SAS token grants limited access rights to Azure resources without exposing an account’s access key. Generate a SAS token to securely upload the file without risking sensitive account credentials.

Upload Document: Use the SAS token to upload the document to the blob storage. This step is important because it allows other services (like the extraction service) to access the file without relying on your local system.

#Step 4: Convert PDF Document to TIFF Format
Set up PDF to TIFF Conversion: Since the document is in PDF format and the Extraction API expects TIFF files, the next step is to convert each page of the PDF into individual TIFF files. TIFF files provide high-quality images and support multiple compression types, which makes them suitable for document analysis.

Convert and Save Each Page as TIFF: Each page of the PDF will be converted into a separate TIFF image. Create a dedicated folder (like ./split/) to store these files, using a naming convention like documentId_page#.tiff (where each file is sequentially named according to the page number).

Log Conversion Results: After conversion, log details including the number of pages and file paths of the TIFF images. This ensures that if something goes wrong, you have a record of the files created and can verify the exact number of pages converted.

# Step 5: Upload TIFF Files to Azure Blob Storage
Prepare TIFF File Paths: After saving the TIFF files, compile a list of their file paths to be used for uploading.

Upload to Azure: Use the SAS token to upload the TIFF files to Azure Blob Storage, just as you did with the original PDF. By uploading these TIFF files, you ensure that they’re available for processing by the Extraction API, which might be running remotely.

Log Upload Confirmation: Record each file’s upload status, including any errors, to ensure each page was successfully uploaded. This logging step provides a full trace of all files handled by the POC.

# Step 6: Generate Metadata for the Extraction API
Create Metadata JSON: The Extraction API will need a JSON structure that includes details like the documentId, callbackUrl, the location of the original file, and the locations of each TIFF file (one entry per page). This metadata allows the API to know where to find the document files and which callback URL to use when extraction completes.

Log Metadata for Verification: Log the JSON metadata in its entirety. This is important for validation, especially if any troubleshooting is required to ensure correct data was sent to the Extraction API.

# Step 7: Authenticate with the Extraction API
Generate an Access Token: The Extraction API requires authorization. Typically, an access token is generated by calling an authentication endpoint. This token acts as proof of identity and grants access to interact with the API.

Store and Secure the Token: Store this access token securely, as it may be needed multiple times. Keep it available for sending in the authorization headers when making the call to the Extraction API.

Log Token Retrieval: Log the successful retrieval of the token, but be careful not to expose sensitive data (e.g., avoid logging the actual token).

# Step 8: Call the Extraction API for Document Processing
Submit Extraction Request: With the token and metadata JSON ready, make a request to the Extraction API endpoint to start the document processing. The request should include the metadata in the body and the access token in the headers for authorization.

Set Up Callback: The Extraction API will use the callbackUrl provided in the metadata JSON to confirm when processing is complete. Make sure the callback URL is configured correctly to receive and handle this response.

Log Response from the API: The API should return a status message or confirmation, which you should log. If there’s an error or failure, note any error details for future troubleshooting.

# Step 9: Monitor Process and Set Up Retry Mechanisms (Optional)
Track Processing Status: Depending on the API’s design, you may want to periodically check the document’s processing status. This monitoring ensures you stay informed on any issues or delays.

Implement Retry Logic: In case of temporary errors, set up a retry mechanism to re-submit the document to the Extraction API after a delay. This helps to minimize manual intervention in case of intermittent failures.

Handle Alerts and Notifications: For any critical errors or completion notifications, set up alerts (e.g., via email or a monitoring dashboard) to notify relevant team members for manual follow-up if needed.

Final Notes and Recommendations
This POC can serve as a foundational workflow for document processing, adaptable for production by enhancing error handling, using asynchronous processing for efficiency, and adding monitoring. Each of these steps is carefully designed to ensure document integrity, efficient processing, and traceability from start to finish.
